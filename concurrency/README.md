# Summary of Concurrency Workshop

This workshop covers essential concurrency concepts and patterns in Go, focusing on practical usage and synchronization techniques. Key topics include:

## Goroutines

- Lightweight threads are managed by the Go runtime for concurrent execution.
  
## Channels

- Used for communication between goroutines.
- Example: Sending and receiving data through channels.
  
## Synchronization Primitives

- Mutexes: Protect critical sections.
- WaitGroups: Wait for multiple goroutines to finish.
- Atomic Operations: Lock-free synchronization.
  
## Channel Patterns

- Worker Pool: Distribute tasks among fixed workers.
- Fan-Out, Fan-In: Distribute work and collect results.
- Select Statement: Handle multiple channels and timeouts.
- Timeout and Ticker: Implement timeouts and periodic tasks.
  
## Advanced Channel Usage

- MirrorStream Example: Mirror data from a source channel to multiple destination channels.
- Verification with WaitGroup: Ensure data is correctly mirrored and verified.
  
## Non-Blocking Operations

- Default Case in Select: Handle non-blocking channel operations.
  
## Context for Cancellation

- Use context.Context for managing cancellation and timeouts.

## Conclusion

This workshop provides a comprehensive overview of concurrency in Go, equipping you with the knowledge to write efficient and safe concurrent programs.
